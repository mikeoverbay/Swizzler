# Swizzler
A tool to help skin World of Tanks.. Tanks

### Version 9
Swizzler was actually saving files upside down!
This is FIXED in this version!!

### Version 8
Fixed a bug in saving 1/4 size and change the way its saved. Its much simpler now.

### Version 7
Remove BC5 type from save options.. This is NEVER used and its a strange format.

### Version 6
Added Button to resize the texture by 1/4. This saves having to save a texture and edit it in an external tool.
Cleaned up the code and removed unused items.
